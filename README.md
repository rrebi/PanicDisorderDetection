In the recent years, the importance of mental health has gained significant attention, showing the need for effective solutions to diagnose and manage conditions such as panic disorder.
Therefore, the main purpose of this thesis is to create an AI-based application aimed to predict the likelihood of panic disorder in an individual. 
Using an open-source dataset, the application integrates three distinct machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier (DT), and XGBoost Classifier (XGBoost).
